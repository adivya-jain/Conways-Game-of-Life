# Conways-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life
Rules are simple 
1. A dead cell will come alive if exactly 3 neighbours are living.
2. A living cell will stay alive if 2 or 3 neighbours are living.
3. Cells with less than 2 neighbours will die of underpopulation, cells with 4 or more neighbours will die of overpopulation.
